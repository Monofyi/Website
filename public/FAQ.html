        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>PRICING</h2>
        <h3>What are the charges for Bitecope app?</h3>
        <p>
            Bitecope is based on monthly subscription model (for more details contact support@bitecope.com), however
            user are provided with 30 day free trial for the first instance when they Sign up. So that, user can try &
            test the app features and assess its use-case before buying it.
        </p>

        <h3>Do we provide refunds?</h3>
        <p>Yes we do provide refunds, only if user have bought the annual subscription.</p>
        <p>Note : Refund is only available for whole package. It's not valid for individual accounts.</p>

        <h3>How the refund amount is calculated?</h3>
        <p>
            So, for example if user has bought our subscription then they will have to pay 7500 INR in total. That means
            they are paying 625 INR per month. If user decides to cancel the subscription then, we calculate the
            remaining month and multiple that with 625
        </p>
        <h3>For example</h3>
        <p>- You bought subscription on 20th November 2021.</p>
        <p> - Subscription is valid till 20th November 2022. </p>
        <p>
            Now, if you cancel subscription on 3rd March then you get money reimbursed of 7 months which is 7 x 625 =
            4375 INR *excluding charges.*
