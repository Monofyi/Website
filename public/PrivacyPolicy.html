        <h2>Tracked User Information</h2>
        <p>
            Log File Information: Our Servers automatically collect limited Information about your device's connection
            to the internet, including your IP address, when you visit our Site or use the App. We automatically receive
            and log Information from the App and/or your browser including but not limited to IP address, your device or
            computer's name, and your operating system, We may also collect log Information from your device, including
            but not limited to your location, IP address, your device's name, device's serial number or unique
            identification number (e.g., Android ID or ADID on your Android Device).
        </p>

        <h2>Accessed User Information</h2>
        <p>
            When Users use the Site (or any of its sub sites) / App, we make good faith efforts to provide Users, as and
            when requested by Users, with access to their Information and shall further ensure that any personal
            information or sensitive personal data or other Information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be
            corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal Information or sensitive
            personal data or Information to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ask individual Users to
            identify themselves and the Information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing
            such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
            require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
            impractical (for instance, requests concerning Information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is
            not otherwise required.
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, where we provide Information access and correction, we perform this service
            free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain
            certain services, after you delete your Information, residual copies may take a period of time before they
            are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems
        </p>

        <h2>Storage And Backup</h2>
        <p>
            From time to time, we take backup of your data on Bitecope App on our cloud database. This is done for the
            purpose of enabling Users to get their data back in case their phone's data becomes unusable, or phone gets
            lost, or the User moves to a new phone device. We also use this backup to provide useful insights and
            information related to their spends such as weekly spends in a month, insights related to spend behavior,
            etc, and to provide information related to User spends, patterns and User data in the form of aggregated and
            anonymized statistics on data such as User spends by category, date, time, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall keep
            User's Information in our records till the period of time when we can potentially offer the Bitecope
            Services to the Users. After such period of time when Bitecope Services are no more relevant to a User, we
            remove all the Information pertaining to a particular User from our records.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Security</h2>

        <p>
            We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or
            destruction of data including accidental or intentional manipulation, loss from access by unauthorized
            parties. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and
            security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
            unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All Information gathered on the Bitecope App is
            securely stored within the controlled database. Access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly
            limited.
        </p>

            Our security measures are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect technological developments. Regardless
            of where your personal information is transferred or stored, we take all steps reasonably necessary to
            ensure that personal information is kept secure, however, please understand that no transmission of data
            over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% (one hundred percent) secure.

            law enforcement and will undertake all measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore
            the reasonable integrity of the data system.

            primary purpose in collecting your information, including Personal Information from you is to deliver the
            personalized Bitecope and its various features. Please note that should you choose to not provide us consent
            to collect your information, including Personal Information, we may not be able to perform the contract with
            you. Where we refer to 'perform the contract' we mean the Terms of Use applicable to your use of the
            Bitecope Service, which means that you may either not be able to access certain features of the Bitecope
            Service, or we may not be able to provide you the Bitecope Service in entirety.
        </p>

        <h2>Revocation Of Consent</h2>
        <p>
            A User can revoke their consent to the processing of their personal information at any time with effect for
            the future. Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and
            disclose personal information where such collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or
            required under applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2>Responsible Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            All the Bitecope Services are currently provided and regulated by Bitecope and therefore Bitecope is
            responsible
            for the collection, storage and processing of personal information of the Users.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>
            We may alter our Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary changes in technology, applicable law or
            any other variant. In any case, we reserve the right to change (at any point of time) the terms of this
            Policy or the Terms of Use. Any changes we make will be effective immediately on notice, which we may give
            by posting the new policy on the Site. Your use of the Bitecope App Services after such notice will be
            deemed acceptance of such changes. We may also make reasonable efforts to inform you via electronic mail. In
            any case, you are advised to review this Policy periodically on the Site to ensure that you are aware of the
            latest version.
